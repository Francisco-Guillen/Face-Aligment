# Evaluation of the Impact of Face Alignment Algorithms on the Performance of Face Recognition Methods

## Overview
With the advance of technology, facial recognition has been widely used in various areas, such as security, access control, crowd monitoring, payment systems and even on social networks, for the automatic identification of people in photos. The facial recognition process usually involves capturing an image or video of the person's face, which is then pre-processed in order to extract the relevant features. 
Data pre-processing is done through facial alignment, which usually consists of ensuring that the position of the eyes, mouth and nose are in the same position for all images. As such, image pre-processing consists of four points:
- Detecting the face in the image;
- Detecting the reference points of the face;
- Obtaining the target points;
- Applying the chosen transformation (Affine, Similarity, Projective).

In this project, the study of image pre-processing was divided into 3 stages: firstly, we studied some facial alignment methods, secondly, the transformations that can be applied and thirdly, how the choice of the number of facial reference points can influence the algorithm.
